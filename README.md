filespitter.sh
===============

filespitter is a really basic script that automates setting up reverse ncat listeners for when you need to download `n` number of files from a host. It starts an infinite loop that prompts you for a file location and sets up the listener. That's it!

Usage: filespitter.sh port [ssl]
